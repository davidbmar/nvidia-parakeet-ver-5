## üìä Comprehensive Logging & Debugging

This deployment system includes a **production-grade logging framework** for easy troubleshooting and monitoring.

### üîç Log File Structure
Each script generates a detailed, structured log file:
```
logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ riva-000-setup-configuration_20250906_143022_pid12345.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ riva-010-deploy-gpu-instance_20250906_143530_pid12346.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ riva-025-transfer-nvidia-drivers_20250906_144530_pid12347.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ riva-040-setup-riva-server_20250906_145012_pid12348.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ check-driver-status_20250906_150203_pid12349.log
```

### üìà Logging Features
- **Timestamps**: Millisecond precision for all operations
- **Sections**: Organized by logical operations (Configuration, Connectivity, Driver Check, etc.)
- **Command Tracking**: Every command executed with full output and timing
- **Error Context**: Complete error information with stack traces and recommendations
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, GPU usage tracking
- **Remote Operations**: Detailed SSH command execution logs

### üõ†Ô∏è Debug Utilities
```bash
# Quick driver and system status check
./scripts/check-driver-status.sh

# Test the logging framework
./scripts/test-logging.sh

# Find recent failures
ls -lat logs/ | head -10

# Analyze specific failure
grep -A5 -B5 "ERROR\|FATAL" logs/riva-040-*.log

# Monitor deployment in real-time
tail -f logs/riva-040-setup-riva-server_*.log
```

### üìã Log Analysis Patterns
**Success Indicators:**
```
[SUCCESS] Configuration validation completed
[SUCCESS] SSH connection successful
[SUCCESS] GPU accessible
‚úÖ [Section Name] completed
```

**Warning Indicators:**
```
[WARN] Driver version mismatch - needs updating
[WARN] Drivers not found in S3, will download them first
‚ö†Ô∏è  [Warning message]
```

**Error Indicators:**
```
[ERROR] Cannot connect to server: [IP]
[FATAL] Configuration validation failed
‚ùå [Section Name] failed: [REASON]
=== ERROR SUMMARY ===
```

## üîß Script Spacing and Extensibility

Scripts are spaced by 5 numbers to allow insertion of additional steps if needed during debugging or enhancement. The logging framework makes it easy to add new steps with consistent error handling and monitoring.

## üîó API Endpoints

Once deployed, your Parakeet Riva ASR system provides:

### Riva Health Check
```bash
GET http://YOUR-RIVA-INSTANCE:8000/health
```

### WebSocket Streaming (Primary Interface)
```bash
# Connect to WebSocket for real-time transcription
ws://YOUR-WEBSOCKET-SERVER:8443/ws/transcribe

# Send audio chunks and receive partial/final results in real-time
```

### Riva gRPC API (Advanced)
```bash
# Direct Riva gRPC calls for batch processing
grpcurl -plaintext YOUR-RIVA-INSTANCE:50051 nvidia.riva.asr.v1.RivaSpeechRecognition/Recognize
```

### Management Endpoints
```bash
# WebSocket server health
GET http://YOUR-WEBSOCKET-SERVER:8443/health

# System status and metrics
GET http://YOUR-WEBSOCKET-SERVER:8443/status
```

## üéõÔ∏è Service Management with Logging

### Riva Server Management
```bash
# On the Riva GPU instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/[key].pem ubuntu@[riva-server-ip]

# Docker container management
docker logs -f riva-server
docker stats riva-server
docker restart riva-server

# Using deployment scripts
/opt/riva/start-riva.sh
/opt/riva/stop-riva.sh

# Check comprehensive status with logging
./scripts/check-driver-status.sh
```

### WebSocket Server Management
```bash  
# On the WebSocket server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/[key].pem ubuntu@[websocket-server-ip]

# Application management
systemctl status websocket-server
journalctl -u websocket-server -f

# View application logs with structured format
tail -f logs/websocket-server_*.log
```

### Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor all recent logs
ls -lat logs/ | head -10

# Real-time log monitoring during deployment
tail -f logs/riva-040-setup-riva-server_*.log

# Check system health across all components
./scripts/riva-100-test-basic-integration.sh
```

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test with curl
```bash
# Health check
curl http://YOUR-INSTANCE-IP:8000/health

# File transcription
curl -X POST 'http://YOUR-INSTANCE-IP:8000/transcribe/file' \
     -F 'file=@test-audio.wav'

# S3 transcription
curl -X POST 'http://YOUR-INSTANCE-IP:8000/transcribe/s3' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "s3_uri": "s3://your-bucket/audio.wav",
       "language": "en-US"
     }'
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check Container Logs
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-INSTANCE-IP
docker logs rnnt-server
```

### Verify GPU Access
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR-INSTANCE-IP
docker exec rnnt-server nvidia-smi
```

### Model Loading Issues
```bash
# Check if model cache exists
docker exec rnnt-server ls -la /tmp/speechbrain_cache/

# Restart container to reload model
docker restart rnnt-server
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

- **g4dn.xlarge**: ~$0.526/hour (recommended for development/testing)
- **g4dn.2xlarge**: ~$0.752/hour (better performance)
- **p3.2xlarge**: ~$3.06/hour (highest performance)

Remember to stop instances when not in use!

## üîí Security Notes

- Scripts automatically configure security groups for port 8000
- SSH access required for deployment
- AWS credentials are temporarily copied to instance
- Consider VPC deployment for production

## üìà Performance

- **Real-time Factor**: Typically 0.1-0.3 (GPU accelerated)
- **Model**: SpeechBrain Conformer RNN-T (~1.5GB)
- **GPU Memory**: ~4-6GB during transcription
- **Cold Start**: 2-3 minutes for first transcription

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
- ‚úÖ GPU acceleration is enabled
- ‚úÖ S3 transcription test completes
- ‚úÖ Response includes `"actual_transcription": true`
- ‚úÖ Word-level timestamps are provided

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the specific step script that failed
2. Review container/service logs
3. Verify AWS permissions and quotas
4. Ensure GPU drivers are properly installed

**Note**: This deployment uses **real RNN-T transcription** with SpeechBrain, not mock responses. The system will actually transcribe your audio with high accuracy using GPU acceleration.
